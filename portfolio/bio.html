      <h1>My Biography</h1>
      <h3>Brief Intro</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Orji Chidera John. I was born on the 18th day of October 2004 in Nigeria.
        I am from the Southeastern part of the country. I am dark in complexion and 5.6" tall.
        I like collaborating with people of like mind — the zeal towards achieving goals and
        learning from mistakes.

      <h2>Educational Background</h2>
      <p>
        I started my primary education in 2010 and bagged my
        <em>First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC)</em> in the 2014/2015 session.
        I began my high school education from 2015–2021, graduating with my
        <em>Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE)</em> results in good grades.
        In 2021, I took a bold step into my tech journey, a skill I love and have passion for.
        Because there were few bootcamps in our area, I started working at a cyber-cafe where
        I learned some computer basics and how to operate a computer system — a great start
        that lasted two years.

      <h2>My Journey Into The Tech World</h2>
      <p>
        Everywhere and every word spoken were all strange. In 2025, I left my former residence,
        moved to Lagos State, Nigeria and started my great journey into tech. There were hundreds
        of bootcamps and job opportunities scattered everywhere as well as tech skills to be
        acquired, but I knew I needed somewhere to start. I registered at
        <em>New Horizon Computers</em> located at Festac Town, Lagos State, where I started my
        full-stack web development training. It wasn't an easy task, but could I quit?
        Definitely no! I had only one option — <em>"DO IT or DO IT"</em> — and that kept me pushing harder.
      I have currently worked on a moviesstore web application which can be used to add a movie to cart and order it. <a href="https://cybervault2.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank" class="btn">Movie store web app </a>
      <p><strong>Currently open to:</strong> Internships, junior developer roles, or collaborative projects.</p>
